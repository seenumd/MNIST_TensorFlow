# MNIST_TensorFlow
### MNIST Classification with TensorFlow
Agenda:
1. Tensorflow
2. MNIST data
	- Collect data with one_hot
	- Get train and test data
3. Define Parameters
4. Build the Graph
	- Define placeholders and Vriables
	- Prediction
	- Loss
	- Optimizer
	- Model Accuracy
	- Logging
5. Execute the Graph
	- Create Sesson
	- Run session on training set
	- Run session on Test set
	- Log the loss and accuracy for train and test
	- Sabe the model
	- Close the session
  
### Predicting with saved model - MNIST
Agenda:
1. Load Saved model
	- List out contents of folder where logs and model is saved
	- Loading the graph
		- Create session
	- Get access to input and output tensors
2. Get data for Prediction
3. Predict the random test data
4. Visualize predicted data
5. Close the session
